C++ Thread pool:

- In this project you can find a fully c watchdog.

- The watch dog can be started by the starting the WatchDogRun function that appears in the watchdog.h file

- The watch dog can be stopped properly only by the WatchDogStop function that appears in the watchdog.h file

- While this watchdog is running the user cannot use SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2

for further instructions and details, see the watchdog.h file.
